    <h1>Welcome to Croissant!</h1>
    The croissant is a sweet, flaky French pastry made from puff pastry dough.
    This crescent-shaped treat has a crispy, buttery texture and is typically
    enjoyed for breakfast or with coffee. Although the croissant is now
    considered a symbol of French cuisine, its origins trace back to Austria,
    where a similar pastry called kipferl was made in Vienna in the 17th
    century. Later, it became popular in France and evolved into the delicate
    pastry we know today through French baking techniques. Some variations of
    the croissant are filled with chocolate, almonds, or cream, offering a
    richer flavor.
